# To-do app
The purpose of this project is to showcase the development of a simple REST API,
using popular technologies like Java, Spring boot and MariaDB.

## The idea
This app assumes the existence of a 'user', which is any application capable of
making request over HTTP. The purpose of this app is to provide to this user of
an API for managing 'tasks', like any other to-do app.

This project doesn't provide a frontend user interface, only providing comunication
over HTTP and JSON data.
